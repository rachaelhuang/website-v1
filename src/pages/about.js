        <p>I’m a product designer and a sophomore at Dartmouth College, majoring in Computer Science and Digital Arts.
          My journey began with a strong foundation in traditional art, which naturally evolved into a passion for graphic design as I became fascinated by the intersection of technology and creativity.</p>
        <p>In college, I discovered product design, a field that perfectly merges my love for art and technology. With new avenues for me to channel my creativity while solving real-world problems, I’m eager to continue crafting intuitive and impactful user experiences that blend form and function.
